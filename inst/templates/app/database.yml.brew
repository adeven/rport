# Contains Database connection settings for all connections and environments
# that your Rport app will work on.
#
# Note: Please do not use the & yaml syntax as the R YAML driver doesnt work
# well with it.
#
# Note: adapter setting is case sensitive. It should match the driver name you'd
# normally use in dbConnect(). Example: PostgreSQL
#
# Other than that, feel free to edit these settings, add/remove environments and
# connections. For more details refer to the Rport readme.
